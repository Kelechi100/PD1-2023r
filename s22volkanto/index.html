				    </figure>
					<p>A <b>Tank</b> is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.</p>
 					<p>The word <b>Tank</b> was first applied to British "landships" in 1915 to keep their nature secret before they entered service</p>
 					<p>The first combinations of the three principal components of the tank appeared in the decade before <b>World War I</b>. In 1903, Captain Léon René Levavasseur of the French artillery proposed mounting a field gun in an armoured box on tracks.</p>
 					<p>The <b>World War II</b> spurred progress in tank building. In just six years, tanks have made a much greater leap than in the previous twenty. A significant part of the tanks acquired projectile-proof armor, powerful guns with a caliber of up to 152 mm, and at the end of the war the first serial night - infrared - sights appeared on German tanks.</p>

 				<p>The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank from World War II. When introduced, its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries and its 60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons.</p>
				<p>The T-34, in fact, was one complete compromise: it had to be both easy to manufacture and repair, fairly light and at the same time with powerful armor, relatively small, but at the same time with high combat effectiveness, easy to master , but with modern equipment. And in some places the T-34 succeeded and in others it didn’t.</p>
				<p>The T-34 was the mainstay of the Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant.</p>
				<p>T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2010 more than 130 were still in service.</p>

 				<h3>M4 Sherman</h3>
 				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Bayeux_char_USA.JPG/640px-Bayeux_char_USA.JPG" alt="M4">
 				<p>The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank M4, was the most widely used medium tank by the United States and Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available in great numbers. </p>
				<p>During World War II, approximately 19,247 Shermans were issued to the U.S. Army and about 1,114 to the U.S. Marine Corps. 
				The U.S. also supplied 17,184 to United Kingdom (some of which in turn went to the Canadians and the Free Poles), while the Soviet Union received 4,102 and an estimated 812 were transferred to China.</p>
				<p>It was also the basis of several other armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled artillery, tank destroyers, and armored recovery vehicles. </p>
				<p>The M4 Sherman evolved from the M3 Medium Tank, which – for speed of development – had its main armament in a side sponson mount.
				The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but moved the main 75 mm gun into a fully traversing central turret. 
				One feature, a one-axis gyrostabilizer, was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the gun aimed in roughly the right direction for when the tank stopped to fire.</p> 
				<p>Later in the war, a more effective armor-piercing gun, the 76 mm gun M1, was incorporated into production vehicles.</p>

 				<h3>M3 Stuart</h3>
 				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/M3A1_Stuart_Tank.jpg/640px-M3A1_Stuart_Tank.jpg" alt="M3 Stuart">
 				<p>The M3 Stuart/Light Tank M3, was an American light tank of World War II. 
				An improved version of the tank entered service as the M5 in 1942 to be supplied to British and other Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war. 
				Afterwards, it was used by U.S. and Allied forces until the end of the war.</p>
				<p>British and other Commonwealth armies were the first to use the Light Tank M3, as the "Stuart", in combat. From mid-November 1941 to the end of the year, about 170 Stuarts (in a total force of over 700 tanks) took part in Operation Crusader during the North Africa Campaign, with poor results.</p>
				<p>The M3 and M3A1 variants were powered by an air-cooled radial engine, either a gasoline-fueled 7-cylinder Continental W-670 (8,936 built) or a 9-cylinder Guiberson T-1020 diesel (1,496 built). Both of these powerplants were originally developed as aircraft engines.</p>
				<p> A further 3,427 M3A3 variants were built with modified hull, new turret and the Continental W-670 gasoline engine.</p>

 				<h3>Panzer IV</h3>

 				<p>The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, is a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.</p>
				<p>The first mass-produced version of the Panzer IV was the Ausführung A (abbreviated to Ausf. A, meaning "Variant A"), in 1936. As main armament, the vehicle mounted the short-barreled, howitzer-like 75 mm Kampfwagenkanone 37 L/24 (7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24) tank gun, which was a low-velocity weapon mainly designed to fire high-explosive shells.</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Panzer_IV-Ausf%C3%BChung_A1939.jpg/640px-Panzer_IV-Ausf%C3%BChung_A1939.jpg" alt="Panzer IV Ausf.A">
				<p>The Ausf. F tanks that received the new, longer, KwK 40 L/43 gun were temporarily named Ausf. F2</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Panzer_IV_1.jpg/640px-Panzer_IV_1.jpg" alt="Panzer IV Ausf.F2">
				<p>The next version, the Ausf. H, began production in June 1943 and received the designation Sd. Kfz. 161/2. The integrity of the glacis armour was improved by manufacturing it as a single 80-millimetre plate. A reinforced final drive with higher gear ratios was introduced.</p>
				<p>Despite addressing the mobility problems introduced by the previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV (Ausf. J) was considered a retrograde from previous variants. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production.
				The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. 
				The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain.</p>

 				<h3>Valentine Tank</h3>

 				<p>The Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine was an infantry tank produced in the United Kingdom during World War II.</p>
				<p> The tank was to carry a 2-pounder gun in a two-man turret, a lower silhouette and be as light as possible, resulting in a very compact vehicle with a cramped interior.</p>
				<p>It was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under licence in Canada. It was used extensively by the British in the North African campaign. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable.</p>
				<p>The Valentine was of conventional layout, divided internally into three compartments: from front to back the driver's position, the fighting compartment with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets. 
				The driver's area contained only the driver and the driving controls.</p>
				<p>Turret rotation was by electric motor controlled by the gunner, with a hand-wheel for manual backup. 
				The restrictions that the two-man turret placed on the commander, made more so if they were a troop commander and responsible for directing the actions of two other tanks besides their own, were addressed by enlarging the turret for the Mark III so that a loader for the main armament could be carried.</p>

 				<h3>Panther</h3>
 				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Panzerkampfwagen_V_Panther_Kubinka.jpg/640px-Panzerkampfwagen_V_Panther_Kubinka.jpg" alt="Panther">
 				<p>The Panther tank, officially Panzerkampfwagen V Panther (abbreviated PzKpfw V) with ordnance inventory designation: Sd.Kfz. 171, is a German medium tank of World War II. It was used on the Eastern and Western Fronts from mid-1943 to the end of the war in May 1945.</p>
				<p>The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 medium tank and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. The Panther was a compromise.</p>
				<p>The Panther was born out of a project started in 1938 to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. The initial requirements of the VK 20 series called for a fully tracked vehicle weighing 20 tonnes and design proposals by Krupp, Daimler Benz and MAN ensued. This project was abandoned and replaced with a new one to counter Soviet tanks.</p>
				<p>The "VK 30.02(DB)" Daimler-Benz design resembled the T-34 in its hull and turret and was also to be powered by a diesel engine. The MAN design embodied a more conventional configuration, with the transmission and drive sprocket in the front and a centrally mounted turret. It had a petrol engine and eight torsion-bar suspension axles per side.</p>
				<p>The commission noted a number of advantages of the MAN project, in particular, a better suspension, a gasoline engine, better maneuverability, and a shorter gun barrel overhang. Considerations were also expressed that the similarity of the new tank with the T-34 would lead to confusion of combat vehicles on the battlefield and possible losses from their own fire. 
				As a result, the unfinished Daimler-Benz prototype stood in the factory yard until the end of the war.</p>
				<p>After choosing a prototype, preparations began for the rapid launch of the tank into mass production, which began in the first half of 1943.</p>

 				<p>The Panzerkampfwagen III, commonly known as the Panzer III, was a medium tank developed in the 1930s by Germany, and was used extensively in World War II. The official German ordnance designation was Sd.Kfz. 141. 
				It was intended to fight other armoured fighting vehicles and serve alongside and support the similar Panzer IV, which was originally designed for infantry support.</p>
				<p>Initially the Panzer III had the same 3.7 cm gun as the infantry used for anti-tank work but later models were given 5 cm gun. However, this was the largest gun that could be fitted within the limitations of the turret ring and it was insufficient against Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks.</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Panzer_III_tankfest_2023B.JPG/640px-Panzer_III_tankfest_2023B.JPG" alt="PanzerIII Ausf.L">
				<p>Instead the Panzer IV which had a larger turret ring, was redesigned to mount the long-barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 40 gun and became the main German tank. 
				The Panzer III effectively swapped roles with the Panzer IV; from 1942 the last version of the Panzer III (Panzer III N) mounted the short barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 that the first Panzer IVs had been fitted with.</p>

 				<p>The Kliment Voroshilov (KV) tanks are a series of Soviet heavy tanks named after the Soviet defence commissar and politician Kliment Voroshilov who operated with the Red Army during World War II.</p>
				<p>The KV tanks were known for their heavy armour protection during the early stages of the war, especially during the first year of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In certain situations, even a single KV-1 or KV-2 supported by infantry could halt German formations.</p>
				<p>The KV tanks were practically immune to the 3.7 cm KwK 36 and howitzer-like, short-barreled 7.5 cm KwK 37 guns mounted, respectively, on the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks fielded by the invading German forces. Until the Germans developed more effective guns, the KV-1 was invulnerable to almost any German weapon except the 8.8 cm Flak gun.</p>
				<p>During the war, the Soviets found it difficult to deal with the concrete bunkers used by the Finns and a request was made for a tank with a large howitzer. 
				One of the rush projects to meet the request was to put the howitzer in a new turret on one of the KV tanks. Initially known as <em>'Malen'kaya Bashenka'</em> (little turret kv) and <em>'Bol'shaya Bashnya'</em>,(big turret kv) the 76-mm-armed tank was redesignated as the KV-1 Heavy Tank and the 152 mm howitzer one as KV-2 Heavy Artillery Tank.</p>

				<p>In response to criticisms, the lighter KV-1S was developed, with thinner armor and a smaller, lower turret in order to reclaim some speed.</p>
				<p>A stopgap upgrade to the KV series was the short-lived KV-85 or Objekt 239. This was a KV-1S with the new turret from the <em>Object 237 (IS-85)</em> still in development, mounting the same <em>85 mm D-5T</em> gun as the SU-85 and early versions of the T-34-85 (not yet in production at the time).</p>

 				<h3>IS</h3>
 				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Belarus-Minsk-Museum_of_GPW_Exhibition-5.jpg/640px-Belarus-Minsk-Museum_of_GPW_Exhibition-5.jpg" alt="IS">
 				<p>The IS tanks were a series of heavy tanks developed as a successor to the KV-series by the Soviet Union during World War II. The IS acronym is the anglicized initialism of Joseph Stalin. The heavy tanks were designed as a response to the capture of a German Tiger I in 1943.</p>
				<p>They were mainly designed as breakthrough tanks, firing a heavy high-explosive shell that was useful against entrenchments and bunkers. The IS-2 went into service in April 1944 and was used as a spearhead by the Red Army in the final stage of the Battle of Berlin.</p>
				<p>The IS-1 was essentially a deep modernization of the previous heavy tank model, the KV-1/KV-1s. The armor protection and armament were significantly redesigned to strengthen it; to improve performance and reliability, the IS-1 received a new planetary-type gearbox. However, in its design, the new tank inherited a large number of parts from KV tanks of various modifications.</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/IS_1_prototyp.jpg/640px-IS_1_prototyp.jpg" alt="IS-1">
				<p>In September 1943, the famous Soviet artillery designer F. F. Petrov sent a letter to the chief designer of <em>ChKZ and pilot plant No. 100</em> about the possibility of installing artillery systems of 107, 122 and even 152 mm caliber into IS tanks. Chief designer chose the 122-mm A-19 cannon to enhance the armament of the IS tank. After agreeing on the technical details, he received consent personally from I. Stalin to install the A-19 cannon in the IS tank.</p>
				<p>The A-19 was modified for installation in a tank - it was equipped with a muzzle brake to mitigate significant recoil, more compact recoil devices, and the controls were moved to one side for the convenience of the gunner in the cramped fighting compartment of the tank. This modified version of the A-19 was named D-25T</p>

 				<h3>Tiger I</h3>
 				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Tiger_BTM.jpg/640px-Tiger_BTM.jpg" alt="Tiger">
				<p>The Tiger I was a German heavy tank of World War II that operated beginning in 1942 in Africa and in the Soviet Union, usually in independent heavy tank battalions. 
				It gave the German Army its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun (derived from the 8.8 cm Flak 36). 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944.</p>
				<p>The initial designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (literally "armoured combat vehicle VI version H", abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H) where 'H' denoted Henschel as the designer/manufacturer. 
				It was classified with ordnance inventory designation Sd.Kfz. 182. </p>
				<p>While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time, it has also been called overengineered, using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. 
				In the early period, the Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable.</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/TigerITankTunis.jpg/640px-TigerITankTunis.jpg" alt="Tiger I(Ausf.H)">
				<p>The tank was later re-designated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation Sd.Kfz. 181.</p>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-299-1805-16%2C_Nordfrankreich%2C_Panzer_VI_%28Tiger_I%29.2.jpg" alt="Tiger I(Ausf.E)">
				<p>The tank was given its nickname <b>Tiger</b> by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the <b>Tiger II</b> entered production.</p>
				<p>Today, only nine Tiger I tanks survive in museums and private collections worldwide. As of 2021, Tiger 131 (captured during the North Africa Campaign) at the UK's Tank Museum is the only example restored to running order.</p>

				<p>The TOG2, officially known as the Heavy Tank, TOG II, was a British super-heavy tank design produced during the early stages of World War II in the case that the battlefields of northern France devolved into a morass of mud, trenches and craters as had happened during World War I.</p>
				<p>The design included a 6-pounder gun and side sponsons. For "initial trials" it was fitted with a mockup turret with a dummy gun and later with a simplified turret mounting a QF 3-inch 16 cwt anti-tank gun</p>
				<p>In 1942 the tank was given a turret that was under development for the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank design with the QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun. The turret "in modified form" was used on the Challenger. The planned sponsons were never fitted.</p>

				<p>In 1944-1945, 6 prototypes of the “Black Prince” were manufactured, several of which were sent to the front for military tests in May 1945, but these vehicles did not have time to take part in combat operations. 
				It was planned to order 300 copies of the tank in May - June of the same year, but by that time prototypes of the promising Centurion tank had also arrived for testing, and therefore further work on the Black Prince, which lost relevance with the end of hostilities in Europe, was discontinued.</p>

				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Metro-maus1.jpg/640px-Metro-maus1.jpg" alt="Maus">
				<p>Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus was a German World War II super-heavy tank completed in late 1944. It is the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built.</p>
				<p>Five were ordered, but only two hulls and one turret were completed, the turret being attached before the testing grounds were captured by advancing Soviet military forces. This vehicle was also built to compete with the Soviet heavy Kliment Voroshilov tank.</p>
				<p>The development of the Maus originates from a contract given to Porsche for the design of a 100-ton tank in March 1942. The Maus was designed from the start to use the "electric transmission" design which Ferdinand Porsche had used in the VK 4501 (P), his unsuccessful attempt to win the production contract for the Tiger. </p>
				<p>The Maus tank was originally designed to weigh approximately 100 tons and be armed with a 128 mm main gun and a 75 mm co-axial secondary gun. Additional armament options were studied including various versions of 128 mm, 150 mm, and 170 mm guns.</p>
				<p>After the war, the commander of Soviet armored and mechanized troops ordered the hull of V1 to be mated with the turret of V2. The Soviets used six <em>Sd.Kfz. 9 18t half-tracks</em>, the largest of Germany's half-track vehicles built until May 1945, to pull the 55-ton turret off the destroyed hull. The resulting vehicle was then sent back to the USSR for further testing and is now at Kubinka Tank Museum.</p>
