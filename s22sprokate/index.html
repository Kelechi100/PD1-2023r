        <p>
            <em>The Maine Coon</em> is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North
            America. The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

            The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, which could be the reason why it has a reputation of being
            referred to as "the gentle giant."

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Maine Coons are renowned for their large and sturdy build. They typically have a muscular body, a semi-long
            coat that comes in various colors and patterns, and distinctive ear tufts. Their friendly expressions and
            bushy tails add to their charm.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The Maine Coon cat is considered the only longhair breed native to the United States. This breed probably was
            introduced by seamen who sailed into New England. The cats they carried on their ships most likely left the
            ship either permanently or just for a little shore leave, bred with the existing native cats, and ultimately
            created a breed of their own.

            The show career for the Maine Coon cat began in New York in 1895 when the best cat award was given to a
            tabby Maine Coon named Leo. Leo kept winning at the Boston cat shows until 1900 when he was defeated by his
            own son.

            After this, the love affair with the Persian began, and the Maine Coon cat dropped into second place in
            popularity. This ranking has changed once again in recent years, and the Maine Coon is now once again
            "America's Cat."
